  work done:
    Updated GCN and GCN+GAT models for O14672
    increased number of features and saved model perfomance in excel sheet 

  work to be done:
    increase the number of epochs and optimise the models
    think abt using graphsage/GIN model along with this (check Ar79)
    retrain the O14672 properly, the epochs right now are too less
    start writing the paper
    make the UI better...?
